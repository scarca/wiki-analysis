# Wiki Analysis

## A Journey to Map Wikipedia

Wikipedia is perhaps the most powerful resource ever to exist. It is a collection of human knowledge from every corner of the globe, kept accurate by a team of dedicated editors who quickly correct any mistake. Each page has links to other pages of related topics, creating a web of knowledge that contains almost every relation known to mankind. I believe that there is tremendous potential in wikipedia. There is the potential to harness all the knowledge it has and create an engine that, given any topic in the world, tell you what it's related to. Such an engine could then be used to power AI, to explore deep relationships between seeminly seperated concepts, and in turn push the boundaries of human knowledge. 

The orginial documentation of my journey through this project can be found [on my Medium page](https://medium.com/@scarca), and a synopsis is available on my new [project blog](https://projects.rajshrimali.com). 

TL; DR: I didn't have the computational resources required to complete this project, because although the wikipedia archive itself is small, the sheer number of links would take forever to create on my laptop and the storage required would be far into the terabytes, if not into the petabytes.
